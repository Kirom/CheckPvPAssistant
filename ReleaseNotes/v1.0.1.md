# CheckPvPAssistant v1.0.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 10, 2025

## 🔧 Critical Fix: Realm Database Corrections

### ⚠️ **Main Fix: Realm Name Formatting**
This release addresses a **critical issue** where players on realms with special characters were experiencing **404 errors** when trying to access Check-PvP URLs.

**Problem**: Realm names containing apostrophes (`'`) or parentheses (`()`) were being incorrectly formatted in the database, causing the Check-PvP website to not recognize the URLs.

**Examples of Fixed Realms**:
- `Aggra(Português)` - Was incorrectly mapped as "Aggra Português" 
- `Ahn'Qiraj` - Was incorrectly mapped as "Ahnqiraj"
- `Al'Akir` - Was incorrectly mapped as "Alakir" 
- `Blade's Edge` - Was incorrectly mapped as "Blades Edge"
- **100+ other realms** with similar formatting issues

**Impact**: Players on these realms can now successfully access their Check-PvP armory pages without encountering 404 errors.
