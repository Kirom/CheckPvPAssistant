---

## 🚨 **Alpha Release Notice**

This is an **alpha release** for testing the new auto-close copy dialog functionality. While the feature is fully implemented and tested, I'm releasing it as alpha to gather user feedback and ensure compatibility across different setups.

## 🎉 **New Features**

### **Auto-Close Copy Dialog**
The copy dialog can automatically close after you press Ctrl+C.

- **Enabled by default** for better user experience
- **Configurable** via `/checkpvp autoclose` command
- **Smart text selection** - automatically ensures text is selected when Ctrl+C is pressed
- **Reliable detection** - uses keyboard event detection for immediate response
- **No false positives** - only closes when text is actually copied

### **New Slash Command**
- `/checkpvp autoclose` - Toggle auto-close behavior on/off
- Integrated into existing help system
- Persistent setting saved between game sessions

## 🔄 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Dynamic Dialog Instructions**
The dialog now shows different instructions based on your auto-close setting:
- **Auto-close ON**: "Press Ctrl+C to copy (auto-closes)"
- **Auto-close OFF**: "Press Ctrl+C to copy, then press Enter or Escape to close"

### **Smart Copy Behavior**
- Even if you deselect text or click elsewhere, Ctrl+C will re-select and copy the text
- Guarantees that pressing Ctrl+C actually copies something to your clipboard
- No "thought I copied but didn't" scenarios

## 🏗️ **Technical Improvements**

### **SOLID Architecture Refactoring**
Completely refactored the UI module to follow clean architecture principles:

- **Single Responsibility** - Each function has one clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns** - Auto-close logic is isolated
- **Improved Maintainability** - Easier to modify and extend

### **New Functions**
- `SetupAutoClose()` - Handles all auto-close functionality
- `GetInstructionText()` - Generates appropriate instruction text
- `HandleCtrlC()` - Manages Ctrl+C detection and response


## 🧪 **Alpha Testing Focus**

I'm particularly interested in feedback on:

1. **Reliability** - Does auto-close work consistently for you?
2. **Timing** - Is the 0.1 second delay appropriate?
3. **User Experience** - Do you prefer auto-close on or off by default? Do you like auto-selecting the text even if you deselect it?
4. **Compatibility** - Any issues with other addons or UI modifications?
5. **Edge Cases** - Any scenarios where it doesn't work as expected?

## 📋 **Migration Notes**

### **For Existing Users**
- Auto-close is **enabled by default** - try it out!
- If you prefer the old behavior, use `/checkpvp autoclose` to disable it
- Your preference will be saved automatically
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

### **For New Users**
- The addon now provides a more streamlined experience out of the box
- Auto-close reduces the number of clicks needed
- You can still disable it if you prefer manual control

## 🐛 **Known Issues**

- This is an alpha release - please report any issues on GitHub
- Auto-close behavior is new and may need refinement based on feedback
