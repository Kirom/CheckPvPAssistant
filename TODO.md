## Fixed / Done

1. **Simple Settings Panel** - [IMPLEMENTED]
   - Added clean interface options panel
   - Accessible via Interface Options → AddOns → Check-PvP Assistant
   - Dropdown selection for copy mode (Full URL or Name-Realm)
   - Checkbox control for auto-close dialog behavior
   - Automatic settings synchronization between panel and saved variables
   - Uses modern Settings API (supported in both Retail and MoP Classic)

2. **Copy Dialog Enhancement** - [IMPLEMENTED]
   - Added option to auto-close copy dialog after text is copied (Ctrl+C)
   - Implemented toggle functionality for auto-close behavior via `/checkpvp autoclose` command
   - Default behavior: auto-close ON by default for better UX, with toggle for users who prefer manual control
   - Auto-close detection works by monitoring keyboard events to detect Ctrl+C key combination
   - Automatically ensures text is always selected when Ctrl+C is pressed to guarantee copy operation

- [FIXED] Realm name bug: Issues with realms containing single quotes or parentheses (e.g., Aggra(Português), Kor'gall) causing 404 errors on generated URLs. This has been addressed by correcting formatting in db_realms.lua for consistency in realm names.
